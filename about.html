			<h2 class='text-center'>What is Racial Literacy?</h2>
			<p class='text-center'>Racial literacy is the ability to read, recast, and resolve racially stressful or identity-based encounters. This literacy is developed through supportive and repeated practice of healthy racial coping behaviors. The training of racial literacy involves the creation of humane spaces that provide affirming and protective feedback that also holds participants accountable as they learn to build their racial confidence, reduce their stress during racially charged moments, and negotiate racial conflicts to healthy conclusions.</p>

		<!--Our Approach-->
		<div class='our-approach container'>
			<h2 class='text-center'>Our Approach</h2>
			<p class='text-center'>While we are aware of and challenge systemic social injustices that shape our communities, we take a more proximal approach to racial conflict resolution. We teach skills that address face-to-face and in-the-moment racial encounters. We expect this work to help participants improve the quality of their racial interactions with colleagues, family members, and friendships; mature their racial identity development, and find their (social justice) voice by strengthening the link between their ideas and actions. We work with all age groups from youth to adults, across various sectors of education, health, justice and business, and across populations of front-line, middle management, and administrative leaders and professionals. By leveraging the power of storytelling and racial literacy skill development, we expect to promote emotional and relationship health on multiple levels. Our direct work begins with practitioners, staff and leaders of organizations, which indirectly impacts their client base, students and/or community. Eventually, we will deliver the direct face-to-face training to the clients (ex. students) themselves. We expect Lion’s Story will cultivate healthy climates and teach practices that influence activists, professionals, families and youth to recognize and resist narratives of racial dehumanization about their histories, cultures, and genius reconnect to and assert their own narratives of trauma and healing recover from the trauma of racism and improve their emotional, psychological, and physical coping and health and record and share the impact of applying these racial coping health processes and behaviors to everyday encounters.</p>
